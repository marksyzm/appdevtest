# appdevtest

To run use `npm i`, run the server in a separate terminal with `npm run start.api` and finally run `cordova run nameofplatform` with name of platform replaced with `browser`, `ios`, or `android`.

## Improvements

I would do the work to make sure the component takes an array of any other element and thus allows for an outside source to use it. The infinite scroll tool uses stencil by ionic as the web component library (like svelte etc). I would also like to run over the data being shown/hidden to be sure it is displaying what it should from top to bottom with any extra time given.

Test environment is also ready to go with `npm test` (none are added just yet).
